# PyTorch Learning Notebooks

This repository contains three structured Jupyter notebooks designed to teach the fundamentals of deep learning with PyTorch.  
The content progresses from basic tensor operations to building and training a full neural network.

### Included Notebooks
1. **Tensor Operations.ipynb** – Introduction to tensors and PyTorch basics  
2. **Custom DataLoader.ipynb** – Building your own Dataset and DataLoader  
3. **Model Creation and Training.ipynb** – Creating, training, and validating a neural network model  

Each notebook is self-contained and can be studied independently.
